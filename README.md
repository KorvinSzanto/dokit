# Poqit

Poqit is a [Qt] library, and cross-platform desktop apps (both GUI and console) for [Pokit] measuring
devices.

This project is in very early stages of development, but aims to support both [Pokit Meter] and
[Pokit Pro], on Linux, Mac and Windows.

*To do: some notes on device x feature x platform x app support matrix.*
