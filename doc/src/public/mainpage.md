# QtPokit

QtPokit is a cross-platform [Qt] library, and console application for accessing [Pokit] measuring devices.

This project is in very early stages of development, but aims to support both [Pokit Meter] and
[Pokit Pro], on Linux, Mac and Windows. A separate project (to launch later) will aim to provide a
cross-platform desktop GUI application using the QtPokit library.

There's a lot more to go here, but in for now maybe jump to the [classes list](annotated.html), or visit
